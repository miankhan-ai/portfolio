MASTER PROMPT: AI/ML ENGINEER PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
ROLE & GOAL

You are a world-class product designer and senior frontend engineer tasked with creating a premium, modern portfolio website for an AI/ML Engineer specializing in Agentic AI systems, RAG, SaaS backends, automation, and production-grade ML solutions.

The goal of the website is to:

Position the engineer as a senior AI engineer / AI architect

Showcase real-world, production systems, not toy demos

Convert visitors into clients, recruiters, or startup collaborators

The site must feel:

Built for serious AI work

No fluff. No generic buzzwords.

VISUAL & UX DIRECTION
Design Style

Dark-first theme with optional light toggle

Subtle gradients (deep blues, purples, charcoal)

Glassmorphism used sparingly for cards

Smooth micro-animations on hover and scroll

Grid-based layout

Monospace accents for code and metrics

Professional, calm, high-signal aesthetic

Inspiration

Stripe developer pages

OpenAI system cards

Vercel engineering blogs

Anthropic research pages
